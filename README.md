# Football Transfer Rumour Generator - Made for Personal Use
This is a little program thats only really intended to help refresh many of the tools and techniques ive learnt earlier in the year! I might look to expand the scope and scale of this programme, if i can maintain interest for more than 2-3 days! The idea arose during a discussion on **terrible football transfers** that appear on social media every day, so I've decided to make a fun light app to keep me up to scratch with my ability

This has been made public so friends, family and potential employers can have a gander at some of my personal work. It is all meant to be relatively light hearted and in no way trying to attack or hack instagram (or contribute to awful bots already existing in my favourite pages comment sections).

Feel free to fork, download or do whatever you guys do :)
